The goal is to measure the Q&#178; dependence of the axial-vector form factor GA. It can be extracted model-independently and as robustly as for electromagnetic form factors from typical electron scattering experiments with low uncertainty, in contrast to the ways used so far to access GA, such as neutrino measurements and pion electroproduction.",

Not many free-neutron characteristics have been measured so far though they are the quantities of fundamental importance for hadronic and nuclear physics. The feasibility was tested with a tool-kit Geant4, whose purpose is to simulate the passage of particles trough matter and their various interactions."

This scenario is called baryogenesis via leptogenesis and is feasible if a theory assuming all neutrinos to be Majorana fermions holds. In addition to light left-handed neutrinos, the theory also predicts heavy right-handed neutrinos with a mass of M. At temperatures around T ∼ M, these neutrinos, through decays out of thermal equilibrium, generate a lepton asymmetry, breaking the conservation of lepton number and CP symmetry. Non-perturbative processes of the electroweak interaction in the Standard Model then convert the excess of leptons into a baryon asymmetry."
